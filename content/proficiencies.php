   <h2>Proficiencies</h2>
   <p>
      Below I detail some of the proficiencies I have in different web technologies:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <h3>PHP</h3>
         <p>
            PHP is pretty much my bread and butter server-side web development language.  What I've loved
            about PHP ever since I've been doing development is the ability to build solutions quickly and easily.
            For myself, PHP seems much more dynamic compared to a platform based on .NET, as it really is just code
            and build your system, as opposed to having to deal with the compilation of DLLs that you have to do with
            .NET.  Perhaps .NET is better suited for larger systems that need the quickness of pre-compiled DLLs,
            but I've never been disappointed in PHP and it's ability to provide solutions to problems on the server-side.
         </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
         <h3>Javascript/Ajax/DHTML</h3>
         <p>
            Ever since I've been doing development now (over 4 years now) I've always been fascinated by the
            ability to dynamically grab information on the fly on the web, an ability that we often take
            for granted with our desktop applications.
         </p>
         <p>
            I had done pure Javascript development for a full year (nothing but Javascript and Ajax full-time!),
            so I feel I'm very familiar about the pitfalls of browser incompatibilities and issues with
            features not being supported for a particular flavor of Javascript for a particular browser.
         </p>
         <p>
            I've come to appreciate Javascript libraries such as jQuery as my development career has progressed,
            and as someone who has hand-coded their Javascript in the past, I cannot begin to describe just
            how much easier it is to use a library such as jQuery to deal with browser incompatibilities as well
            as doing complicated DOM traversals!
         </p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <h3>CSS and CSS-P Layouts</h3>
         <p>
            CSS is definitely what I would consider one of the strengths of my skillset.  I've learned
            much of what I know about CSS on my own, as many places I've worked at insist on using archaic
            HTML layouts!  I'm a big fan of CSS-P to make website layouts that can be modified later due to
            good CSS design, but I've learned to compromise with CSS and HTML when the CSS solution is much
            more convoluted than the HTML solution.
         </p>
         <p>
            So in other words, I appreciate the ability to control layout using CSS, but when a simpler solution
            in HTML is available (judicious use of tables for some lists, for example), I will use that instead.
            The most important thing I see is making sure the website looks the way I want it to, and I try
            to use all the tools at my disposal to make that happen.
         </p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <h3>SQL Server/MySQL and other database management systems</h3>
         <p>
            I've been working with DBMS (Database Management Systems) for almost as long as I've been
            doing development, so I'm well versed with writing SQL queries, joins, stored procs for
            SQL Server and MySQL based applications.  So I would probably rate myself as a DBMS developer,
            but to warn you I haven't done much on the Administrator side, I've mostly done SQL in order
            to make my applications work well with the database layer.            
         </p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <h3>C# and/or .NET based Web development</h3>
         <p>
            My experience with C# and .NET based technologies have been mostly on the maintenance side.
            Often times, when I've come into a company that uses .NET for the web applications, they're usually
            in the process of migrating to a LAMP stack, so often times I've used C# and .NET in terms of
            maintaining or transferring functionality to a PHP based system.  That's not to say that I can't
            develop in .NET, but my forte is definitely on the PHP and Ajax side at the moment.
         </p>
      </li>


      <li>
         <h3>HTML</h3>
         <p>
            I learned HTML by hand coding everything, so much of what I do in terms of development is using
            good ol' notepad or a similar text based editor to create my web pages. So needless to say, I'm
            pretty well versed and comfortable in building entire websites from scratch by hand-coding them.
         </p>
         <p>
            My experience with WYSIWYG editors is fairly limited I must admit, with limited experience with
            Dreamweaver and Frontpage when I first started out.  I've often found that the code generated from
            these applications has not been to my liking, so I often hand code everything to make sure that
            the code is easily modifiable and meets my expectations.            
         </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
         <h3>Facebook Development</h3>
         <p>
            I have some experience developing iFramed applications using the Facebook platform.  My experience
            with Facebook is that I found putting up applications fairly easy to do on the Facebook platform,
            but I had to watch out for changes with their API.            
         </p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <h3>CMS Experience (Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress)</h3>
         <p>
            I have some experience maintaining and working with CMS systems, although when left to my own devices
            I often prefer to write to my own code based on the needs of the system I'm trying to create.  I guess
            my feelings about CMS systems is that they seem to try to apply a catch-all solution to different problems,
            and sometimes the solution (the CMS system) doesn't fit the problem in hand.
         </p>
         <p>
            That's not to say that I can't help modify or add features to a website that already uses a CMS,
            it's just that I usually believe in using the right tool for the right situation.
            The extendability of CMS platforms such as Drupal or Joomla is very helpful in this regard,
            but like I had mentioned before, when using a CMS sometimes you are subject to the artificial
            rules that a CMS system may impart on your website.
         </p>
      </li>

      <li>
         <h3>Actionscript, Flash, HTML 5 and other emerging technologies</h3>
         <p>
            I have fairly limited experience using Actionscript, but during my limited time using it I found
            it very similar to Javascript and fun to use, so I know in the case of an application using
            Actionscript I can pick it up pretty easily.
         </p>
         <p>
            That being said, I find the promise of HTML 5 very interesting, especially in the areas of
            browser-native graphics and media, and I will probably head in that route as opposed to
            becoming more proficient in Actionscript in the future.
         </p>
         <p>
            Mobile development and developing websites for mobile devices is another area that I'm also
            interested in learning and getting better at, as the mobile market is growing daily, and
            web and application developers that are proficient at developing mobile-friendly websites are
            are people that are making our future internet that much better, and that's something I
            definitely want to be a part of.
         </p>
