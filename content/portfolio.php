            Magnify360.com is a company that does website optimization for large and medium sized companies.
            I've done work ranging from setting up a backend site to enable lead generation to front end development.
            Most of the work I've done there involve taking Photoshop mockups from various designers, slicing them up, and
            creating HTML/Javascript/CSS code out of it that works across all browsers.
            I make every effort to make sure sites created are pixel perfect and designed to spec.

         xAutomator was an internal project for a marketing company I do work for every so often with.
         The purpose of the xAutomator is to help automate and simplify scheduling tasks that would
         otherwise be done by hand.  The linked site is a simplified version of the actual site, but feel free
         to test drive it a bit.

            FlyersUnite.com was a simple site that I put together when I bought my JetBlue All You Can Fly
            ticket in 2010.  The purpose was to see where other people were going during that time so people can
            arrange to meet up if their itineraries match.  It was a quick prototype to test out an idea,
            but there's a bit of nifty Ajax in that you can do a search for a given location
            and the results will update in real time.

            MonsterTrade.com was a site that I did some freelance work for back in 2006. The premise of the
            site was giving students a central meeting ground to conduct trades for books, computers, and other
            stuff that students might need. The site itself isn't active anymore, and I didn't do the principal
            design for the website itself (it does load a bit slow, and the HTML code is a bit bloated),
            but the first major project that I did outside of a full time job is still present in the
            form of the Professor Ratings page on the site.  I also did some miscellaneous updates to the site
            as well, but the Professor Ratings section was definitely the major addition that I and a colleague of
            mine made to the site.  Since MonsterTrade.com my skill set has improved immensely, but I still
            look back fondly on this project, as it's a milestone representing what I was able to accomplish
            in only six months in this field.
