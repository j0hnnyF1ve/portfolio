      <p>A side project, a photo gallery templating system.  For basic photo galleries, sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Flickr work great, but I wanted something where I could have more control on the display of the images.  This one is more of a simple slideshow with animation and text.</p>

      <p>Magnify360.com is a company that does website optimization for large and medium sized companies. I've done work ranging from setting up a backend site to enable lead generation to front end development. Most of the work I've done there involve taking Photoshop mockups from various designers, slicing them up, andcreating HTML/Javascript/CSS code out of it that works across all browsers. I make every effort to make sure sites created are pixel perfect and designed to spec. You can take a look at some of my better efforts by clicking on the link.</p>

      <p>xAutomator was an internal project for a marketing company I do work for every so often with. The purpose of the xAutomator is to help automate and simplify scheduling tasks that would     otherwise be done by hand.  The linked site is a simplified version of the actual site, but feel free  to test drive it a bit.</p>

      <p>MonsterTrade.com was a site that I did some freelance work for back in 2006. The premise of the site was giving students a central meeting ground to conduct trades for books, computers, and other     stuff that students might need. The site itself isn't active anymore, and I didn't do the principal  design for the website itself (it does load a bit slow, and the HTML code is a bit bloated), but the first major project that I did outside of a full time job is still present in the form of the Professor Ratings page on the site.</p>

      <p>I also did some miscellaneous updates to the site as well, but the Professor Ratings section was definitely the major addition that I and a colleague of mine made to the site.  Since MonsterTrade.com my skill set has improved immensely, but I still look back fondly on this project, as it's a milestone representing what I was able to accomplish in only six months in this field.</p>
